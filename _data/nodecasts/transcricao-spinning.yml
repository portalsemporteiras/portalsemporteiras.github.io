  A song plays. The Narrator’s voice, Marcela, enters

  Welcome to Nodecast, a podcast from the PSP network. In the last episodes we raised the discussion about territories and their occupations, bringing voices from the neighborhood and a tech layer, for you to know a little more about what makes up our ground and what are the stars that guide us to continue the work of the association. This is the story of PSP told by those who made or make it happen.

  The history of this network began in 2015, in this same Mantiqueira mountains where we are, only further ahead in the Paraíba Valley for those going towards Rio de Janeiro. There, near Resende, is a village called Fumaça. And it was from there that the following call came:

  The second narrator, Luísa, announces:

  "The Cloud - Rural Station of Art and Technology invites you to the Fumaça- Fumaça Data Springs gathering. During 10 days in July, we will install a wifi mesh network and a GSM cellular point in a collective work format in the Village of Fumaça."

  Marcela

  And so we went. Me, Hiure and Dorah.

  Hiurê

  To be close to the earth, to be close to the food that I can grow and eat, to be close to the animals, to be close to nature... and also to be close to technology – as an extra element inside this universe.

  Marcela

  That was the general vibe: people, nature, shared care for food and cleaning through assorted roles described in a paper glued to the wall, and a lot, a lot of ideas in our minds...

  Hiurê

  Technology can be our ally, it cannot be something that is coming up against us. So, A Nuvem (The Cloud) proposes this perspective of human beings in the centre, being able to be associated with technology in a more harmonious way. Right now we are reflecting on the web, the internet, on what these equipments are... on demystifying all this. In reality, everything that seems big and complicated is actually simple, and it is being made by someone. And if one person can create these things, any other person can do it as well.

  Marcela

  At the meeting in Fumaça, there were people who had already built a community internet network, people who wanted to do it, and people like me who didn't really understand what was going on. But everyone was engaged and willing to help in whatever possible to connect the village.

  Hiurê

  There, in the village, they don’t have a numerous population, so for telecommunications companies it is not lucrative to bring their technology here. For a company, the most important thing is profit, so it was not worth it for them.

  Marcela

  It was carrying these good news and this information that we arrived here in the Souza neighborhood. We came thirsty for community life: after living very isolated for more than a year, it was good to be able to do things together. When we saw the precariousness of the internet services available in the neighborhood we started to tell about what we had seen there at the Nuvem meeting. Marie got to know the idea and liked it.

  Marie

  I remember Hiurê sharing all these ideas, and we got really excited, me and my husband, since we were really excited about autonomy in growing our food, permaculture, building our own ecological home... and then there was yet another form of living a more sustainable life! We could actually include digital communications within permaculture. That was what motivated us. We really enjoyed the idea of taking this matter into our hands.

  Marcela

  The idea of autonomy that was already circulating in our closest conversations, and we were building the discourse and the core of our shared internet network. At the same time, other meetings were taking place and other processes of autonomy and the seeds of work such as what the CSA [Community that Supports Agriculture] is today, were being talked about in the same circles, in the same balconies.

  Marie

  I remember there were so many meetings over at our house, around the big dinner table, and Yuri would bring to the group the ideas of Sociocracy...

  Hiurê

  We went over to Ede’s land, he said it would be ok for us to simply put on the ground a stick with a router on top of it. Then we put another one of those at Brisa’s house, and also at Leo’s house.

  Marcela, Narrator

  So, in practice, our network starts here. Three routers installed in three houses over there in the Quaresmeiras hill, talking to each other and sharing an internet connection. The internet used to arrive by radio from the newly arrived Internexo [the internet company that operates in the neighborohood]. For a long time, the only way to connect was Claro's expensive and limited 3g service. This means that the first provider to serve the central areas of our neighborhood had finally arrived.

  Hiurê

  Before they had their first costumers they were already searching who would install it. And immediately I called them, and explained our ideas. And they said ‘no, we have absolutely no interest!’.

  Marcela

  And so we hired a 1 MEGA internet deal over at our home in the Quaresmeiras Hill. The internet would get to our house, and then we shared it with those three other points, and get them to connect to each other and share this connection. There was a real need for technical knowledge to make this happen. That was when we decided to invite the community of the neighborhood to be a part of this challenge. We booked a meeting at the local school.

  Marie

  There were a lot of people at that first meeting. We presented the project, our association, the laws, our rights, all that.

  Yuri

  I remember that at that meeting we got the feeling that some people felt inhibited to enter the school, people thought they had to be personally invited, and so we decided to move the meeting to the street – which was the neighborhood’s central square. And then it was that typical chaos we have on the square! And I am often thinking about collective organizations, and I saw that and thought, ‘Gosh, are we sharing this idea too soon?’ .

  Marcela – Narrator

  We really wanted more people to have internet, but we didn't want to be a provider working to offer connection like Internexo does - the idea was different.

  Marie

  A lot of people expected only this: to get an internet reception.

  Yuri

  I remember debating the name the project would have. While it didn’t have a name, we called it “Souza’s Internet”. And we wanted to change that name, so it wouldn’t be confused with some kind of public service, and not a community, collective action, which is quite different than public actions. It has a lot more to do with people being envolved than with a right someone has.

  Marcela – Narrator

  The lack of internet was a collective problem, and we were proposing a collective way to solve it. And so, a couple of people who understood this point, started to integrate our group.

  Vanessa

  We arrived the neighborhood in 2007, there was absolutely no internet. And I found out about you guys [PSP] through Liam, my oldest son. He had heard some talking at the central square about a community internet for our neighborhood, and I found this a very interesting idea, and so I started going to the meetings. And it was cool, usually we don’t have much of a clue about what the internet really is, how it works... and I found out how it works, how absurd it is what they charge for internet connection. I always say that if radio groups had figured out a way to charge for the amount of time we listened to the radio, we would have payed a fortune to the radio. And that way I got more and more envolved in PSP, always seeking this community idea of an internet. Made by us, for us to use, paying fair prices...

  Hiurê

  At that point, people started saying that what we were doing was illegal. It became a big gossip in the neighborhood. People would say that if we started doing it, they were going to report it.

  Marie

  It was right around the time that Internexo was arriving at the neighborhood... and then someone started this gossip.

  Vanessa

  This made us start searching for different approaches. How could we do this in a legal way? We studied a lot the legislation about the internet in Brazil, which is still very crude. There aren’t really a lot of community internet groups in Brazil, you know?

  Narrator – Marcela

  At the time we started researching the theme, there was no legislation that addressed the particularities of a community network, that is, we would have to fit into the existing molds as if we were a small provider. We faced problems with Internexo. These were shared with Anatel [Brazil’s National Agency for Telecommunications], and they said we would have to take this to the Consumer’s Protection and Defense Programme [PROCON, in Portuguese]. We then understood that it would have to be done by ourselves, walking through the gaps so as not to sound illegal. The first logical step was to formalize the collective as an Association. At this time it is difficult to remember the order of the facts, because it really seems that everything happened at the same time.

  Tânia

  Coolab is a community network lab. A collective of people who experiment, work with, use these technologies – computers, systems, related to the infrastructure to the connection between machines and also betweeen people, right? Coolab received funding from Mozilla in a project for increasing community networks around the globe. In this project, the plan was to implement community networks in different places... and while the team was discussing possibilities, they realized that PSP was highly suitable. And it was one of the communities that received this funding for initianing a structure. They knew that here there was already a project being drawn, there were people who were interested in it, there was a technician of the area who was interested in it, and it is situated in a neighborhood that operates as a community. So, why not have this territory as a place to test these ideas?

  Hiurê

  I was telling the guys to make the project here. We were already working on it, we already had a group, our network was called “Souzas Livre”.

  Marcela

  "Free Souza Network" was the temporary name we used when we wanted to get rid of the so-called "Souza’s Internet", which later became Associação Portal sem Porteiras [Gatless Gateway Association]. As we showed that we were relatively organized, we received that support from Coolab and Mozilla, for our installation. So, PSP started with a bunch of Coolab routers, which until today we have not been able to return in value because we have not yet reached financial sustainability of our network. But don't worry, Coolab! That debt is not out of our sight.

  Yuri

  I remember a meeting when we started debating about the tower (communications tower), that would be installed at Miragaia’s house, the meeting was at Marie’s house. We also did some work on Sociocracy, we tested some decision making strategies...

  Narrator - Marcela

  We decided to take a big step: install a tower on a mountain in our neighborhood that could see both São José [the big city nearest to us] and Souza at the same time. Then we could finally leave behind the hiring of Internexo and its headaches, and have a cheaper and more powerful connection from the big city. We found this place on Miragaia's land, and Miragaia agreed to install it.

  Hiurê

  I have a picture of me, in 2017, at the scrap heap, where I bought a tower, and we were going to connect to São José. ]

  Marquinhos

  One day we were over at my place, not really knowing what would happen, and Miragaia stopped by there. We didn’t have much contact with Hiurê yet. And so a bunch of us got together and went up that mountain, with bamboos, all the equipment. We raised the tower, screwed all the parts together, did the whole thing.

  Narrator – Marcela

  An important parenthesis here. It was in the middle of this task of climbing the tower that that we met Marquinhos. He fell a little by chance and ended up meeting us and integrates the group until today.

  Marquinhos

  So, I saw that the project seemed really cool, I really liked Hiurê. We met, he explained the whole idea to me.

  Lia

  I met those guys and they were talking about how they needed more people to help taking the equipment up the mountain. And I said: oh yeah, I’m definitely going! And I climbed the actual antenna, you know? I got almost to the highest part of it, and I was like “Wow, man, you can see everything from up here!” You could see the entire neighborhood and also São José [the big city nearest to us].

  Hiurê

  So, we raised this tower. From April until August, we were working up there, to make the whole thing work. Then, in August, we were able to connect with São José. And we made a 8 Megabyte link with the city, and we still have that, until these days.

  Narrator – Marcela

  This Tower endeavor happened in 2018. Right after that, something happened. In January 2019, Coolab invited me to a meeting, where they invited me to be a part of the group. Up until that point, the group was composed only by men. They needed at least one woman in the group, so they could enroll for a specific funding. Although I thought Coolab’s work was very important, I was pregnant and about to deliver my baby – and accepting this job meant, in a near future, having to travel with a new born. But I accepted the invitation.

  In March 2019, I was on a plane with Hiurê and Amina, flying to Naiorobi, Kenya. Although I’m absolutely sure I never want to do something crazy like that, that trip was important for me to discover my role in all this. During the meetings of the international groups we were part of, gender issues were often raised, and that brought me thoughts about my own experience that I could not name until then. We came back, and I would take a new role: bring more women to community networks. That was when Lu came along. And this partnership was vital for the next steps in PSP.

  Luísa

  When I met Marcela and Hiurê, and, therefore, PSP as an idea and a practice, the whole thing seemed very interesting. But at the same time... so confusing. And Hiurê would explain a lot of things, and I asked questions, and very patiently he would answer. But still, how could I find a place for all of that in my daily life? I also started talking to Marcela as well. And I realized that, although she is someone who gets her hands dirty, she had very similar questions. She also told me about APC, Association for the Progress of Communication. An international organization composed by some crazy people like us, who manage money from fundings and launch public notices to support great projects that deal with technology around the globe. She told me that there was an opened call at that very moment, and it had the goal to decrease technology’s gender abyss. We took a look at ourselves, at our territory, and realized that this abyss was very real here, where we live. That men were far more connected to the techniques, and that women felt miles away from those. That was when we started to plan on doing something about this.

  Marcela

  2019’s first semester was in between travels, antennas and public notices. Everything was going well. But, since the network is made out of people, we are often exposed to conflict.

  Marquinhos

  Then there was that whole thing with Miragaia, and we had to remove the antenna. It meant moving the entire structure, finding a new place...

  Yuri

  We removed the antenna, and found a place with the lady from the Monteiro family, over at the other side [of the neighborhood]. We left the previous place and started walking through the mountains with a GPS trying to open up a trail that didn’t pass through anybody’s property. We wrote down some geographical spots, informed the group about them, and so we began the saga of moving all the stuff.
  And so one day we went to put up the actual tower. Man, we were hiking up the mountain with so much stuff: the chainsaw, cement, sand... it was exhaustive, going up such a steep mountain! I remember going up with one 30 kilos cement bag. When we got there, we split in two teams – some people would prune some trees on the spot to open up some space; and another group took the trail through the top of the mountain to go and get the antenna over at Miragaia’s land. I remember the battery was extremely heavy, it had aproximately 100 kg. We built a bamboo structure with the battery in the middle of it so we could carry it over our shoulders. That was me and Marquinhos, and I remember being surprised that Marquinhos went to this mission wearing flip flops, and there were spots when the grass would go up to our shoulder, man!
  Right after this whole saga of transporting pieces of the tower, we took the tower itself. That day there was a bunch of people, around 20 of us. After that we went a few more times and installed the equipment bit by bit. In the middle of the way, the mobilization faded away, because the optic fiber Internexo connection arrived at the neighborhood. So, it got much easier to keep PSP going, because it needed to keep going, through this opctic fiber signal that getting the signal through the antenna from São José.

  Marcela

  After all, in order to focus our energy and expand the network’s structure throughout the neighborhood and increase the number os associates, we chose to keep on sharing the network connection we had gotten from Internexo. Until that moment, we would share the internet from my house. And although we are not competition - because we are not a service, but a community initiative – Internexo never took us very kindly. And people gossip that, when their signal is weak, PSP is to blame for, because our signal would somehow get in the way of theirs. That is not true. We use the frequencies that are allowed and do not cause interferences. We were then and still are now within our rights, because Anatel [the government communications institution] allows us to connect with up until 5,000 people, as long as we are registered in their portal. And we have been registered there for quite some time, we have always had concerns and attention to the legal aspects of PSP.
  And so, we got to the middle of 2019, an important moment for the History of PSP here at our neighborhood.
  Luísa

  Do you remember that we told earlier about a public notice from APC that was opened to subscriptions? And that Marcela and I took a chance and submitted a project for Souza’s neighborhood? We got approved. Wow, it was such a joy! And that joy spread throughout the second semester of 2019.
  A very important part of the project was the Women’s Circle. There, we would sit in circles, got to know each other better, brought our doubts and questions, talked about our pains, our curiosities, and learned together. Tânia, our famous ‘digital potato’, taught us a lot of things, and she did it in such a delicate way, giving us room to feel like we were building something, and not experiencing some kind of lack – lack of knowledge, lack of courage – no. The idea was to demistify, do something new together. And by being together, gain strenght. In addition to that, five of those women became researchers for PSP, and they did something truly amazing. They went after other women in the neighborhood. Women they thought were interesting, who they wanted to document. And so, after a lot of coffee, cake, conversations, feelings and stories told, they created web pages. Web pages that showed these women in a map. The Map of the Souzas neighborhood women. Obviously the women in this map do not sum up all the amazing women in the neighborhood. They are all amazing women. But we made an effort to put there the most women that we could. And my gosh, what an effort did these researchers do! They had to write texts, make pictures, edit the images, tape and edit audio files, search for songs... and choose an unique way to portray each woman through the digital language. The union needed to create the women’s map was definitely unforgettable.
  It was still 2019, and we had another amazing event. Coolab (remember it?) decided to have a second Coolab Camp. A meeting that happened here at Pandavas with people from all over the world who were connected to community networks. There really were people from all over: people from Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, people from different parts of Brazil. That was the first time I understood we were part of a global movement. It was amazing to feel a part of this. And to me, it brought a new perspective about what it meant to be a part of PSP – it meant that we were part of a collective movement, effort and idea, to change to outdated way in which things are still being done today.

  Satu

  That day when we had that party for presenting the Nodes that Bond project, was one of those special days of everybody in the central square. There were people serving food, Ana was there organizing everything, people eating the food...

  Ana

  Me, Vivi and my dad made the food, my dad was helping me. We decided to prepare rice, beans, farofa [typical dish made with manioc flour], a lot of salad, and polenta [a typical dish, like a corn puree], and there wouldn’t be any meat. But, closer to the day of the party, some people in the community donated boar meat. Since everybody is having a lot of issues with the boars, because they are eating all of their crops, people donated some of it’s meat for this lunch. It was a big success. [‘The boar’ here means the ‘Boar-Pig’ a man-made crossing between wild boar and large domestic pigs for meat production at the south of the country that has gotten out of control, destroys crops and has become a very serious environmental issue].

  Satu

  Computers were out in the street, the screens, the Hard Drives, all the devices... [laughs]. The entire PSP structure suddenly left the inside of their headquarters and got out to the open, like PSP was inside out. The server was there, and the community network was there, operating, for whoever wanted to take the mouse and navigate through it. And the big attraction of the local network that day was the Women’s map, which was developed by many hands, of many women in this neighborhood.

  Lia

  It was a moment for real celebration. We were truly satisfied with the work we had done. Those of us who were researchers dove into amazing stories.

  Satu

  It became such a positive memory. And this also sums up the Nodes that Bond project, right? Moments of celebration, of being together, of deep conversations, of a bunch of people navigating computers together [laughs].

  Ana

  And that was the last lunch we had at the central square before the pandemic.

  Luísa

  In March of 2020, after the carnival, we were at the peak of people’s involvement, and a strong desire to grow as a group. Then, the pandemic arrived, changing all of our plans. Everything got crazy, a big weight fell over us.
  The issue of technology had become urgent. With people isolated, they became much more dependent on technology, and how you use technology can save or destroy you. It all sounded very discouraging, and it still does, but the truth is that we slowly managed to calm down and focus on the question: what can we, as autonomously organized human beings, can do to help those around us?
  We didn't know very well, and we didn't feel very organized, really. We had a network, but we did not yet have a space to house this network, to transform this into something tangible. And that was when we had great news. PSP would finally have its own headquarters. That red house over there, you know, right next to the central square? That’s it. We haven’t officialy opened it yet, because of the pandemic, obviously. But that place is the Portal sem Porteira’s Network new headquarters. And having an actual place to be changes everything.

  Catarine

  I moved in to the neighborhood in april of 2020. I was already a teacher at the school, and I didn’t even have an internet connection to work with the kids, and a lot of them also didn’t have internet connection. And so I realized there was a need to map the kids that had some kind of equipment at home for online classes, who had internet reception, what were the conditions the group was in.
  When I dove into this research, very quickly people started talking about PSP.
  And so I went over there, told them my story – that I was a teacher at the local school, and that I was looking for partnerships to deal with the demands that were coming up with this whole twist that happened due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Very quickly we started searching for alternatives.

  Cacá

  We were watching the big confusion that was going on about the online classes, and I was also without internet connection at home to keep up with the activities... and that was when I realized that it was necessary for me to really become a part of the association, and search with more people for solutions to problems that were very real to me. That was when we started the ‘Tech Mondays’. It was a movement to try and increase our network, to take the nodes to more distant places.

  Catarine

  We went there to study, to qualify this online teaching process for the kids, for the school. That was when I started to understand better what the PSP internet really is, what is this Mesh Network. From the work we were doing during the Tech Mondays, we managed to raise some equipments, reuse and reycle some devices for the kids at the school, we managed to expand the network here at my house since I’m a teacher, we also managed to include a few students in the Network...

  Narrator – Marcela

  This emergency growth of the network demanded a lot of effort from everyone, but especially Hiurê and Marquinhos had a lot of work to do all around the neighborhood trying to solve the technical issues that constantly came up, until one day...

  Marquinhos

  Hiurê texted me saying he was coming over, I got out of the house with my computer in my hands, when suddenly the police came in and said there was a report on a motorcycle without the license plate, something like that. And so I entered home, called my neighbor whose motorcycle was the issue. And the police entered my house, went up a small ravine at the back of the house, and up on the walls I had some baby plants in vases behind the roof [weed plants]. The policemen saw it, took me and my brother outside, said something, I immediately said it was all mine. And I was taken, and spent 7 months in prison.

  Marcela

  With Marquinhos’ imprisonment, our whole network was disrupted. He had always been a strong part of the group, and together with Hiurê, handled the whole functioning of the network. And besides all that, he was also our friend.
  We were sad, destabilized, wearing masks and with more people showing up to become associates, we started ellaborting new ways to organize our group.

  Catarine

  We looked at each other, understood that we had a group with a wide range of different kinds of knowledge and desires, and loads of things to learn from each other.

  Narrator - Marcela

  One of the actions we took was the creation of Carla, a depersonalized secretary. The idea was to take away the idea of "Hiurê's internet", of demands that fell upon him socially, and pulverize these actions in a collective. We, as a group, knew well that to make the network happen we needed technical knowledge, but that was one of the many tasks that this network demanded. Marquinhos stayed in prison for 7 and a half months, 6 of which he was waiting for the trial.

  Marquinhos

  The cell was ok, it was some kind of special cell, it wasn’t any person who could go in there, it was some kind of a cell for sports, something that they have over at the jail. And there were some cool guys there, we would chat for hours, and I told them all kinds of things I had learned – I told them that the optic fibers travelled across the oceans, that the internet travels the oceans, Hiurê told me that so many times. And they would say “No, the internet comes through satelites!”, and we argued, and they would say “Man, you’re so smart, so smart!”...
  I would tell them about the printers we have, the work we do at PSP, I told them everything, and they were very interested. I would tell them that when I left I wanted to continue this work, at PSP I learned so many things. I tried to talk about the terminal and this kind of thing, I would get ansious trying to tell a lot of things, and they kept saying how smart I was. I told them that at some point Hiurê offered me to go on an exchange programme somewhere, how I had missed that opportunity and ended up there... The first time I got a salary it was an APC project!

  Marcela

  On the 6th of November, 2020, still on the pandemic mood, we all gathered in front of PSP to welcome Marquinhos as he came home.

  Marquinhos

  I left jail, and of course Marcela, Hiurê and everyone from our association, they were completely there for me the whole time. I got out and there was a Bamboo Tower project going on.

  Narrator - Marcela

  This project where Marquinhos already arrived working on, was the Bamboo tower prototype, another project that was supported by APC.

  Marquinhos

  I got here and the project was halfway through, Hiurê told me to come to work the next day. I left jail one day, and the next I was already back working at PSP. I would get there by the afternoon, see how it was going, how the tower would work. Hiurê, Fabinho and I went on building each part, Lu was recording the whole thing. It was so cool to build it, and by the end of it, to place the last piece of the tower on the top, and installing the LibreRouter...

  Narrator – Marcela

  Because we are an association, we follow the rules from our own statute, which says that we need to elect a new board of directors every two years. Because we are in a pandemics, we left a ballot box in the headquarters, where the associates could come and vote. There was no surprise when the only team that was candidate: Bambu Bananeira [Bamboo-Banana Tree].

  Lia

  What do we need to keep going? What must be done for this whole project to keep happening? Be president? That was kind of thrown to me, actually [laughs]. “How about you for president?” - and I was like “Me? But...”. And I was like, okay, then, cool. And I think that my presence on the board speaks of this whole movement with women that arrived through Nodes that Bond. I think there’s something about being truly into the whole idea, about being committed to these processes. And I am here to contribute, come what may.

  Luísa

  And that much is true: this board is quite different from the first one. It is entirely composed by women. Women from this territory. This much envolvment brings us a lot of joy. It shows that, the mission Marcela figured out she had way back there, when she was travelling around and realizing her role in the community networks universe, was being accomplished. Lia is one of those women. And she is the great enthusiast of a dream that has been growing. The PSP Radio.

  Cacá

  I was with Lia during an online Radio course. It was very enriching, we learned a lot, we accessed a lot of free tools... and this Radio story was and still is being built. I think it’s fantastic that we have a physical place, where we have equipment, tools that contribute for us to document everything that is going on... it’s so great to turn immaterial cultural assets into something materialized, a document that we can access and isn’t lost, you know? Of course orality is also a valuable way to transmit knowledge...

  Narrator – Marcela

  The Radio is part of a project in which we are very interested as an association: researching ways to tell our stories, and the technologies that can be used to do so. Among us, we share a love for the idea of the local network, the intranet, or internal network, and all the possibilities within it.

  Catarine

  I see the local network as an instrument for documenting and protecting the memory, with a strong connection to how we can act in the present moment to rescue the past and take care of the future. In the local network, the data, the information circulates between the nodes that belong to this network, the intranet, which is a virtual territory which only existir for those connected to it, for those who are a part of this great web.

  Narrator – Marcela

  The local network expresses, in many ways, the alternatives that exist in response to the fast advances in technology. Some people ask how fast the internet is, if they will be able to have inline meetings, but we have left this race aside a long time ago. The fastest, the best, the latest fashions, have very little to do with what we search. What we really want is to revisit our relationship with these technologies, learning together how to express our power through these tools – whether they are digital or not.

  Catarine

  And so, instead of looking directly at what is out there, we start looking at our neighbors, and that brings us closer, keeps the relationships in the present moment. Instead of increasing our relationship with the screens, it has the potential to decrease those, for the cellphones and computers to simply be just another instrument in our daily lives, not the reason for our day to happen. That’s what we are talking about.

  Marquinhos

  I want all this to keep moving forward, for people to come closer to the project, I want more people with us, in the association, not on the internet – I mean, what is the internet, really?

  Narrator – Marcela

  This podcast is the final episode of a series that you can find in the PSP website. There, you will also find our fiction work, a radio novella called “The secret of the mountain”. We continue searching for new ways to keep working and communicating, even during this pandemic, and ellaborating beyond it. We have been dreaming about the opening of the PSP headquarters, where, in the future, we will meet. Until then, we will tidy up the house and keep on connecting through electromagnetic waves in the air.

  The PSP song enters:

  “Clear the paths Open the gates And the windows I’m on my way
  Sending electromagnetic Wave through the air
  Clear the paths Open the gates And the windows I’m on my way
  Sending electromagnetic Wave through the air
  With 5.8 we connect the routers And 2.4 users to server Creating autonomy for us to communicate
  Clear the paths Open the gates And the windows Let’s all connect”

  Original lyrics in portuguese:

  “Abram alas As porteiras As janelas Eu vou chegar
  Enviando ondas Eletromagnéticas pelo ar
  Abram alas As porteiras As janelas Eu vou chegar
  Enviando ondas Eletromagnéticas pelo ar
  Com 5.8 conecta roteador Com 2.4 usuário e servidor Levando autonomia pra gente comunicar
  Abram alas As porteiras As janelas Conectar”
