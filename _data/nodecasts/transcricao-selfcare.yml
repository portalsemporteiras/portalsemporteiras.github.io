  A quick-rhythmed beat begins to play, and Woman 1 (Ana) begins to speak:

  “Since the beginning of the pandemic, I have been going through a process of searching for independence of buying so many products. So, I started researching to learn how to make my own soap. It worked. Then, I started making my own laundry soap. It worked again. I got excited to make my own sourdough bread starter, which I always thought was too complicated and that I could never do it. But then... I did it! It may seem silly because these are all small things, but they actually have great impact on self-esteem.”

  Her voice fades off, beat keep playing and enters Narrator 1 (Marcela):

  “Coming straight from the Mantiqueira Mountains on the second full moon of Autumn, this is the Nodes thatBond on quaratine! Last semester we were side by side creating new ways to be in the world, and since this year we can’t be phisically together once again, let us then take comfort out of the stories told by within our group.”

  Woman 2 (Keity) enters saying:

  “So, Nodes that Bond asks me what have I been doing to protect myself. I am Keity, I am turning 35 years old in a few days, and I’m here doing quaratine as well. Has it been already fourty days since I’ve been homewith my kids and all that? Well, what I’ve been doing to protect myself... I wake up every morning and makea green juice or a juice with oranges and yams for me and the boys”

  Woman 3 (Ju):

  “Yam juice. Everyday... I add all kinds of things, yam, beetroots, pineapple, passionfruit, berries... I make itin the morning and I drink it throughout the day with my son.”

  Woman 2 (Keity):

  “We have been drinking a lot of lime juice, both our lime trees are filled. I have also been hydrating my skin and hair with loads of avocado, eating loads of avocado.... Limes and avocados, avocados and limes...”

  A playful song enters. Woman 4 (Ligia):

  “I’m feeling good, being close to nature like this makes us calm. Being here in this neighborhood, in this place where we are... brings a lot of calm. Breathing well, walking around through the mountains, a bit of meditation, playing songs, creating a lot by myself with my instruments.”

  Woman 5 (Lia):

  “My greatest gift has been going for walks. I wake up really early and go for a walk – the other day I even ran for a bit. And this early morning movement has a refreshing effect on me. It makes me more concentraded, strong. When I come home, things are more fluid, my family at home can feel that I am more in sync. The women are in the core, at least in my home I notice that I have a central role in the family, and ifI am not strong in my foundations, if I am not firm in what I feel, need, or think, all things at home get out ofpace. So, I need to be firm and strong, flowing, breathing, and well. So, all the rest becomes easier...”

  Woman 3 (Ju):

  “Everyday when I wake up the first thing I do is to thank the sun. I take my first rays of sun, and I thank it, our great grandfather.”


  Woman 6 (Alê):

  “I firstly do the Sun Salutation with my 6 and 11 year-old kids. This is something we already did before the pandemic times. Besides that, I also do my daily Yoga practice. But now, these practices suddenly have a different taste and feel. They are stronger. They taste like self care... I bring awareness to vibrations of love, of healing, golden and violet colors for the entire planet... I vibrate for a new, renewed planet.”

  Woman 7 (Soraya):

  “Well, when I wake up, I usually enjoy doing some breathing exercises that strengthen my lungs. Some are from Yoga, some are from theater and singing. The best moment of my day is this one: the meditation. It is wonderful to practice pleasures that your conquer little by little. Then, I bathe in clay. Clay is wonderful for detoxifying. Using clay is taking inflammation out of life! (laughs). And I am in touch with my several friends, aho! I am also in touch with healing, reading tarot cards in a long distance way – not online, but through other connections. If I don’t know the person they will send me a photograph. Me and the one who’sconsulting with me, we connect through the astral plane.”

  Woman 8 (Regina):

  “To me, the challenge of protecting myself from my own unbalacing thoughts, is greater than protecting myself from external things: disease, news. These thoughts can take me to an uncomfortable state of fear andanxiety. So what I’ve been doing is enjoying my own company. Bringing myself to my own body, what I cantake to sensing and breathing.”

  Woman 9 (Maiza):

  “Now I only go to the town center wearing a mask, with my hand sanitizer in the pocket. Usually when I go with my partner we take turns and only one of us leaves the car. I haven’t been alowing the kids to leave the house. Aside from that, I have been trying to keep a healthy mind, filtrating the constant news and information, contacting and talking to people a lot, especially when questioning myself where will our lives go...”

  Woman 10 (Jaque):

  “On friday night I got sick. From friday on I was sick for over ten days – I had a fever, feeling some symptoms... I thought it might be coronavirus, but we can’t know, there’s no testing – there wasn’t and until now there still isn’t. Since then, I stayed home with my family – my daughter and my partner – and feeling very lost. In the first few days I couldn’t do anything... after about fourteen days I became more active at home again. We were always trying to renew things, creating and recreating... after I got more active again I liked it, because I felt I was feeling more living in the present. I feel more active. There are days when the sadness comes, there are so many news... the political situation is horrible, or president is a jackass, there aredays when things are horrible, the energy gets really low... there are great days, bad days, lazy days, active days... this also has to do with my menstrual cycles, I know that. I try to enjoy the fertile times when I feel more active for creating... I have been doing artistic crafts, as well as bindge watching series, watching movies, wasting time online... I have no expectations yet on when this quaratine will end, we can’t know, right?”

  Woman 11 (Satu):

  “Being around people makes us feel protected... If I’m surrounded by people who I love and trust, I feel protected. So, in these times when we see less of the ones we love, it affects our sensation of being unprotected... It feels like a cloud of danger over our heads. And we miss people, right? Missing people perhaps makes us more vulnerable? How to find strengh in the feeling of missing someone? How can we find our power not only despite missing people, but in this feeling of missing them? What protects me is my daily life. Right here, right now. Now I am home, I am okay. I don’t know where or how I’ll be tomorrow, me or my loved ones. But I will conect with here and now, which is all I have. Nobody ever had the “tomorrow”... but perhaps the virus draws more attetion to that feeling, which can cause a lot of anguish in us, mere mortals...”

  Woman 12 (Marcela):

  “I try to take care of my time, so it won’t swallow me whole. Allow my body and my feelings to be, create a scheduele with the kids, avoid diving into the texting world, which can be so negative... at the same time that being productive and a role model is always imposed on us – which is a big capitslistic trap – so many distractions on social network, so much media all around take away our own time, and we are convinced thatwe need to be productive with our time, but they also rob us of our time. It’s like a constant feeling of disastisfaction, which is the greatest trap. To me, if you need healing and processing, all you need to do is sleep some more (laughs)! If you need care, you own body can take care of itself. If you fast for a little whileand sleep some more, give your body time and space, you will heal.”

  Narrator 1 (Marcela):

  “But how do the digital technologies of communication and information influence our self care? Our beloveddigital tutor Tânia brings us a bit of her perspective on Fake News during Corona times. When the moon passes by the Scorpio constellation, it is time to, once again, go through everything we have learned... on theinternet.”

  Tânia:

  “Coronavirus has changed all of our relationships with people, online and even with ourselves. It demands from us a big change in our behaviour to prevent sickness... And how can we prevent from so much out there? How can we prevent from the viruses as well as from the information on the virus itself? In a pandemic moment such as this one, there’s so much of this dynamics: “someone who told someone else who told me”... and social media is constantly in our hands, right? We go to sleep and we wake up and the thing isright here with us. How can we prevent and “desinfect away” misinformation? How do we prepare ourselvesto not follow any random recipe against coronavirus? “Eating a cup of red beans every day is medicine against coronavirus”... who studied that scientifically, how is that a fact? Still, it can be an information that is sent away in phones! Someone receives information from sombedoy they trust, and send it to someone else. That is so common among human beings, because we are willing to protect those who are near us. Also,when we learn something new, we feel like telling more people...

  So what are fake news? Basically, they are misinformation. They are basically lies, and a lot of people believe them. People are once again believing that the earth is flat, and that vaccination is bad for us. A lot of fake news are actually someone’s opinions, which arrive on our medias as actual facts. How do we find out what is fake? You must look for reliable resources, always search for the same information in more places. Search for the news on Duck Duck Go!

  So, should I open every link I receive? Should I share every link I receive? Should I share news if I didn’t even read the entire website? Where did the news come from? And it’s not enough that the news came from acertain study... we should search for studies from reliable institutions. Pay attention to the news you receive, and pay attetion to the news you share. That piece of information can also be harmful for you in two more ways: it can cause you paranoia and anguish – and that why we need to develop a filter in our minds to understand how to actually be careful and safe. Also, fake news can also open space for internet crimes, sincethey are usually about something that triggers fear or anxiety. For instance, you receive a message from someone saying they are from the local health care system, and that they are collecting the phone number of everyone in the neighborhood so it is easier to contact everyone, so they will send a pass code to you and so on... that could be someone trying to kidnap your whats app account, for instance. What are they doing with you account? Probably not sending happy birthday to your friends...

  Narrator 2 (Luísa):

  The dream of a connected world, where we share horizontally our experiences and feel less lonely evolved tosomething we couldn’t have seen coming. Every time you like something, every time you use your credit card, everytime you use ythe phone’s GPS, a digital trail is left behind you. This trail is a result of your online activities, and it is unique. This trail generates a constant flow of information, which is made only for you, and seen only by you. It is your world, custom-made. Try and notice the Youtube suggestions for you. Are they diverse? Do they present a broad range of points of view? Usually not. They follow a certain line ofworld-view, changing only its packaging. This happens because your digital trail creates a very well built profile of you, it is what keeps you comfortable while navigating in the network. Not only does it offer you the exact kind of products you want, but it also shows you a social reality that operates according to your beliefs, and ir even presents news and opinions that are actually very convenient. That is dangerous. It generates a one-sided view of our reality. The algorithms are so powerful they can actually change your real life behaviour, inducing your choices towards someone else’s profit. If we really think about it, it is a real loss in your free-will. Whoever owns our informations, can meticulously manipulate our custom-made universe. And we don’t actually know who owns that information – we don’t read the tiny letters in the apps policy with which we agree when installing the app. We end up accepting that our data is shared with others removing the apps responsability, for instance...

  The flat earth believers that Tânia mentioned is a growing group of people, and the documentary “The earth is flat” approaches this subject very well. On the documentary, we see a large and diverse sample of people defending the idea that earth is flat, and that all images published by Nasa which show the earth as round would be a conspiracy. The scientists tend to get irritated and ridicule the flat earth believers, and in fact it is quite unbelievable that people would think that. What happens is: these people are building they’re world view based on opinions, not facts. Several people, all together, in one-sided world view groups. If you have alarge community of people telling you that the earth is flat, perhaps it will sound more believable. What if your Youtube channel shows you thousands of videos with people defending this idea, and doing experiments to prove it? Even if the experiments are not truthful and scientific, all this information does not sound so fake anymore when everything inside your custom-made world echoes that.

  In fact, how did we all establish our own truths and beliefs, if not refering to things that were taught to us as facts? This is why the scientific method and methods for news and data checking are vital to our health as a community. They work as a pact that we all made together, and that we need to keep. It is a collective responsability.

  The flat earth believers from the documentary let us know that they are constantly being called crazy, and that they have lost friends and family for entering this rabbit hole of beliefs. When we confront them from high heels, the reaction usually reminds us of a battle, where sides attack one another. When things get to that point, facts and opinions no longer differ between each other, and nobody wins.

  Does this sound like a family lunch in 2018 Brazil? Yes, and that is no accident. Who here doesn’t have a beloved family member that voted on someone you despise? Is this person a complete idiot? Is it that simple? What made this person vote in such a way? In the US Elections in 2016, Cambridge Analytica bought the information inside apps like Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, Whats app and so on. They did that so they could get extremely detailed profiles on American voters. If you were an American citizen, they could tell whats scares you, what calls your attetion, and what would make you change your mind. Global politics is built on war strategies – and dividing to conquer is one of them. Taking care of your data, checkingfacts, paying attention to your clicks and shares are big tasks to all of us in today’s world. With a new wolrd, come new responsibilities.

  A song plays. Tânia speaks:

  During these coronavirus times, we have to keep our eyes opened, be aware, be present in our bodies, moments, our lives. The same should happen with our data, our digital life. Be present. Don’t be clicking on your phone while talking to someone, don’t click on whatever shows up on your whats app... How can we live our lives with one action after the other, instead of doing five things at the same time? Living five lives all at once is very tiring and you end up not living any of them fully. Thats it, guys. Kisses, love you all!

  A song plays:

  “To be present and aware,
  Of myself and my body.
  Equilibrium takes care of us,
  And the care is made from nodes that bond.

  I’m dressed up in talismans.
  It all belongs to the invisible plain,
  The women from my family protect me.

  Our instincts guide us,
  Something like a rage,
  I am myself the fire of protection.

  The danger in danger
  Is to not let love in,
  A bubble where nothing penetrates.

  Our instincts guide us,
  Something like a rage,
  I am myself the fire of protection.

  On the journey side by side with women,
  I protect myself when I’m connected
  Being all that I am.
  On the journey side by side with women,
  towards love.

  On the journey side by side with women,
  I protect myself when I’m connected
  Being all that I am.
  On the journey side by side with women,
  towards love.

  Narrator 2 (Luísa):

  You have just heard the Nodes that Bond theme song, composed by the group in one of our project meetings,and now beautifully arranged and recorded by Lia Aroeira and Ligia Kamada.

  Narrator 1 (Marcela):

  We will keep on recording our conversations and sharing with you all. For our next meeting, we would like to hear from you: “Who did I touch that I shouldn’t have? Exception cases during isolation times.” Send us an audio! If you want to send an anonymous story, you can send us in writting and another women can record it. We’ll be waiting for your story until the New Moon...
